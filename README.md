My name is Izundu Chinonso Emmanuel (**Izuchi**, for short & ease). I'm a passionate software engineer with a drive to create innovative solutions that make a difference.

With a strong foundation in computer science and a keen eye for detail, I design and develop software applications that are efficient, scalable, and user-friendly.

I'm always excited to take on new challenges and collaborate with others to bring ideas to life. My expertise includes HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, React, MongoDB, ExpressJS, NextJS, NestJS PHP, Laravel, Node, SQL, NoSQL, Python, C/C++, Cloud Computing, Machine Learning, etc. 

When I'm not coding, you can find me reading, listening to music, watching movies or animes. I'm always looking for opportunities to learn and grow, and I'm thrilled to be a part of the tech community.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently more actively learning ML/AI and everything programming; as learning never ends, it's always a continual process

- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on and contribute to projects that provide innovative solutions to problems
